    bird2: update to 2.16.1
    
    The bird package has been updated to include a patch that directly fixes the
    alignment issue, which previously required the use of the -mno-unaligned-access
    GCC flag on ARM processors. This patch, originally discussed on the BIRD mailing
    list [0], modifies the net_addr structure to resolve the alignment problem
    without needing the workaround.
    
    By incorporating this patch, the alignment issue is addressed more efficiently,
    eliminating the performance, code size, and hardware optimization drawbacks
    associated with the GCC flag.
