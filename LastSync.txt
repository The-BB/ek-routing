    mesh11sd: update to version 4.1.1
    
    Maintainer: Rob White rob@blue-wave.net
    
    Compile tested: All
    
    Run tested: arm_cortex-a7_neon-vfpv4, mipsel_24kc, mips_24kc, aarch64_cortex-a53;
        On 23.5 and master/snapshot.
    
    Description: mesh11sd (4.1.1)
    This release provides a critical bug fix.
    In non-cpe peer mode, if the portal node dhcp6 server fails to respond or cannot be reached,
    multiple instances of odhcp6c are created, resulting in an eventual oom condition.
